## Discription

The Ambedkar Reading Circle is developing an open-source web app to help communities and student groups independently access and facilitate Dramas of Discrimination workshops. This app will serve as an online facilitation guide, a repository for workshop materials, and a data portal.

Workshops can be submitted as case studies, including a charter of demands from participants, contributing to a broader manifesto of inclusion rooted in constitutional values.
