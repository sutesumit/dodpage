- **Facilitation Guide:** Provides structured guidance for conducting in-person workshops.
- **Resource Repository:** Stores workshop materials and exercises for easy access.
- **Data Portal:** Allows submission of workshop case studies, including charters of demands from participants.
- **Manifesto of Inclusion:** Aggregates insights to contribute to a broader manifesto rooted in constitutional values.
